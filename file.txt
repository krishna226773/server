COnstructor: It is a method of a class it will be called while creating object of the class, by default there is default constructor.
             We can overload constructor as many as we want.
             
             
Specialization: This we acheived using inheritance.
Generalization: this we aceived using interface.

Inheritance: It is acquiring the features of a existing class.
             We can't convert parent object to child class reference varaible.
             we can convert child object to parent class reference variable. But we are able to access only parent class methods and variables.
